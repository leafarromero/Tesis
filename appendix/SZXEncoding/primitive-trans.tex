\section{Implementation of primitives in Proto-Quipper-D}%
\label{sec:primitive-trans}

The implicitly recursive primitives defined in Section~\ref{sec:fragment}
can be implemented in proto-quipper-D as follows.
The implementation has been checked with the \texttt{dpq} tool
implemented by Frank Fu (see \url{https://gitlab.com/frank-peng-fu/dpq-remake}).
