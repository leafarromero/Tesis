\section{Discussion}

In this article, we presented an efficient method to compile
parametric quantum programs written in a fragment of the Proto-Quipper-D
language into families of SZX diagrams.
We restricted the fragment to strongly normalizing terms that can be represented
as diagrams.
Additionally, we introduced a notation to easily compose elements of a diagram
family in parallel.
We proved that our method produces compact diagrams
and shown that it can encode non-trivial algorithms.

A current line of work is defining categorical semantics for the calculus and
families of diagrams, including a subsequent proof of adequacy for the
translation. More work needs to be done to expand the fragment of the Quipper
language that can be translated.

We would like to acknowledge Beno√Æt Valiron for helpful discussion on this
topic, and Frank Fu for his help during the implementation of the
Proto-Quipper-D primitives. This work was supported in part by the French
