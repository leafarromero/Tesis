\section{Conclusion}

% Introduction
In this chapter, we presented an efficient method to compile parametric quantum programs written in a fragment of the Proto-Quipper-D language into families of SZX diagrams. We restricted the fragment to strongly normalizing terms that can be represented as diagrams. Additionally, we introduced a notation to easily compose elements of a diagram family in parallel. We proved that our method produces compact diagrams and shown that it can encode non-trivial algorithms.

% Lambda D

% Encoding programs as diagrams families

% Application example

% Future work
A current line of work is defining categorical semantics for the calculus and families of diagrams, including a subsequent proof of adequacy for the translation. More work needs to be done to expand the fragment of the Quipper language that can be translated.
