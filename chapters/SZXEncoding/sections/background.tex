We describe a quantum state as a system of $n$ qubits corresponding to a vector in the $\C^{2^n}$ Hilbert space. We may partition the set of qubits into multi-qubit \textit{registers} representing logically related subsets. Morally, these registers will be interpreted as vectors in our language. Quantum computations under the QRAM model correspond to compositions of unitary operators between these quantum states. Additionally, the qubits may be initialized on a set state and measured. However, we will not provide a probabilistic reduction to perform the measurements. We will only make the distinction through typing.

High-level programs can be encoded in Quipper~\cite{Green2013quipper}, a Haskell-like programming language for describing quantum computations. In this work we use a formalization of the language called Proto-Quipper-D\cite{fu_tutorial_2020} with support for linear and dependent types. Concrete quantum operations correspond to linear functions between quantum states, generated as a composition of primitive operations that can be described directly as a quantum circuit. Generic circuits may have additional parameters that must fixed at compilation time to produce the corresponding quantum circuit.
