	Abstract = {Dagger compact closed categories were recently introduced by Abramsky and Coecke, under the name ``strongly compact closed categories'', as an axiomatic framework for quantum mechanics. We present a graphical language for dagger compact closed categories, and sketch a proof of its completeness for equational reasoning. We give a general construction, the CPM construction, which associates to each dagger compact closed category its ``category of completely positive maps'', and we show that the resulting category is again dagger compact closed. We apply these ideas to Abramsky and Coecke's interpretation of quantum protocols, and to D'Hondt and Panangaden's predicate transformer semantics.},

We focus here on a very important property of the language: completeness, which roughly ensures the equational theory captures all of quantum mechanics. We first improve on the known-to-be-complete presentation for the so-called Clifford fragment of the language -- a restriction that is not universal -- by adding some axioms. Thanks to a system of back-and-forth translation between the ZX-Calculus and a third-party complete graphical language, we prove that the provided axiomatisation is complete for the first approximately universal fragment of the language, namely Clifford+T.},

	Abstract = {Most work in quantum circuit optimization has been performed in isolation from the results of quantum fault-tolerance. Here we present a polynomial-time algorithm for optimizing quantum circuits that takes the actual implementation of fault-tolerant logical gates into consideration. Our algorithm re-synthesizes quantum circuits composed of Clifford group and T gates, the latter being typically the most costly gate in fault-tolerant models, e.g., those based on the Steane or surface codes, with the purpose of minimizing both T -count and T -depth. A major feature of the algorithm is the ability to re-synthesize circuits with additional ancillae to reduce T -depth at effectively no cost. The tested benchmarks show up to 65.7\% reduction in T -count and up to 87.6\% reduction in T -depth without ancillae, or 99.7\% reduction in T -depth using ancillae.},

@article{heyfron_efficient_2018,
	Abstract = {Before executing a quantum algorithm, one must first decompose the algorithm into machine-level instructions compatible with the architecture of the quantum computer, a process known as quantum compiling. There are many different quantum circuit decompositions for the same algorithm but it is desirable to compile leaner circuits. A fundamentally important cost metric is the \$T\$ count -- the number of \$T\$ gates in a circuit. For the single qubit case, optimal compiling is essentially a solved problem. However, multi-qubit compiling is a harder problem with optimal algorithms requiring classical runtime exponential in the number of qubits. Here, we present and compare several efficient quantum compilers for multi-qubit Clifford + \$T\$ circuits. We implemented our compilers in C++ and benchmarked them on random circuits, from which we determine that our TODD compiler yields the lowest \$T\$ counts on average. We also benchmarked TODD on a library of reversible logic circuits that appear in quantum algorithms and found that it reduced the \$T\$ count for 97{\textbackslash}\% of the circuits with an average \$T\$-count saving of 20{\textbackslash}\% when compared against the best of all previous circuit decompositions.},

@article{aleks_kissinger_reducing_2020,
	title = {Reducing {T}-count with the {ZX}-calculus},
	abstract = {Reducing the number of non-Cliﬀord quantum gates present in a circuit is an important task for eﬃciently implementing quantum computations, especially in the fault-tolerant regime. We present a new method for reducing the number of T-gates in a quantum circuit based on the ZX-calculus, which matches or beats previous approaches to T-count reduction on the majority of our benchmark circuits in the ancilla-free case, in some cases yielding up to 50\% improvement. Our method begins by representing the quantum circuit as a ZX-diagram, a tensor network-like structure that can be transformed and simpliﬁed according to the rules of the ZX-calculus. We then show that a recently-proposed simpliﬁcation strategy can be extended to reduce T-count using a new technique called phase teleportation. This technique allows nonCliﬀord phases to combine and cancel by propagating non-locally through a generic quantum circuit. Phase teleportation does not change the number or location of non-phase gates and the method also applies to arbitrary non-Cliﬀord phase gates as well as gates with unknown phase parameters in parametrised circuits. Furthermore, the simpliﬁcation strategy we use is powerful enough to validate equality of many circuits. In particular, we use it to show that our optimised circuits are indeed equal to the original ones. We have implemented the routines of this paper in the open-source library PyZX.},

Together these enable us to describe all observables of finite dimensional Hilbert space quantum mechanics. The resulting equations suffice to perform computations with elementary quantum gates, translate between distinct quantum computational models, establish the equivalence of entangled quantum states, and simulate quantum algorithms such as the quantum Fourier transform. All these computations moreover happen within an intuitive diagrammatic calculus.},

	abstract = {A leading choice of error correction for scalable quantum computing is the surface code with lattice surgery. The basic lattice surgery operations, the merging and splitting of logical qubits, act non-unitarily on the logical states and are not easily captured by standard circuit notation. This raises the question of how best to design, verify, and optimise protocols that use lattice surgery, in particular in architectures with complex resource management issues. In this paper we demonstrate that the operations of the ZX calculus --- a form of quantum diagrammatic reasoning based on bialgebras --- match exactly the operations of lattice surgery. Red and green "spider" nodes match rough and smooth merges and splits, and follow the axioms of a dagger special associative Frobenius algebra. Some lattice surgery operations require non-trivial correction operations, which are captured natively in the use of the ZX calculus in the form of ensembles of diagrams. We give a first taste of the power of the calculus as a language for lattice surgery by considering two operations (T gates and producing a CNOT ) and show how ZX diagram re-write rules give lattice surgery procedures for these operations that are novel, efficient, and highly configurable.},

All of these languages use certain diagrammatic decorations, called !-boxes and phase variables, to indicate not just one diagram but an infinite family of diagrams. These decorations are powerful enough to allow complete rulesets for these calculi to be expressed in around fifteen rules. Historically rules involving !-boxes have not been verifiable by computer. We present the first algorithm for reducing infinite families of equations involving !-boxes into finite verifying subsets. The only requirement for this method is a mild property on the connectivity of the !-boxes. Previous results had focussed on finite case analysis of phase variables in ZX, a result we also extend for ZW and ZH, as well as providing a general framework for further languages. The results presented here allow proof assistants to reduce infinite families of problems (involving combinations of phase variables and !-boxes) down to undecorated, case-by-case verification, in a way not previously possible. In particular we note the removal of the need to reason directly with !-boxes in verification tasks as something entirely new. This forms part of larger work in automated verification of quantum circuitry, conjecture synthesis, and diagrammatic languages in general. The methods described here extend to any diagrammatic languages that meet certain simple conditions.},

	abstract = {Graphical languages, like quantum circuits or ZX-calculus, have been successfully designed to represent (memoryless) quantum computations acting on a finite number of qubits. Meanwhile, delayed traces have been used as a graphical way to represent finite-memory computations on streams, in a classical setting (cartesian data types). We merge those two approaches and describe a general construction that extends any graphical language, equipped with a notion of discarding, to a graphical language of finite memory computations. In order to handle cases like the ZX-calculus, which is complete for post-selected quantum mechanics, we extend the delayed trace formalism beyond the causal case, refining the notion of causality for stream transformers. We design a stream semantics based on stateful morphism sequences and, under some assumptions, show universality and completeness results. Finally, we investigate the links of our framework with previous works on cartesian data types, signal flow graphs, and quantum channels with memories.},

	abstract = {Finding a denotational semantics for higher order quantum computation is a long-standing problem in the semantics of quantum programming languages. Most past approaches to this problem fell short in one way or another, either limiting the language to an unusably small ﬁnitary fragment, or giving up important features of quantum physics such as entanglement. In this paper, we propose a denotational semantics for a quantum lambda calculus with recursion and an inﬁnite data type, using constructions from quantitative semantics of linear logic.},

	abstract = {String diagrams were introduced by Roger Penrose as a handy notation to manipulate morphisms in a monoidal category. In principle, this graphical notation should encompass the various pictorial systems introduced in proof-theory (like Jean-Yves Girard’s proof-nets) and in concurrency theory (like Robin Milner’s bigraphs). This is not the case however, at least because string diagrams do not accomodate boxes — a key ingredient in these pictorial systems. In this short tutorial, based on our accidental rediscovery of an idea by Robin Cockett and Robert Seely, we explain how string diagrams may be extended with a notion of functorial box to depict a functor separating an inside world (its source category) from an outside world (its target category). We expose two elementary applications of the notation: ﬁrst, we characterize graphically when a faithful balanced monoidal functor F : C −→ D transports a trace operator from the category D to the category C, and we then exploit this to construct well-behaved ﬁxpoint operators in cartesian closed categories generated by models of linear logic; second, we explain how the categorical semantics of linear logic induces that the exponential box of proof-nets decomposes as two enshrined functorial boxes.},

	abstract = {We present a complete optimization procedure for hybrid quantum-classical circuits with classical parity logic. While common optimization techniques for quantum algorithms focus on rewriting solely the pure quantum segments, there is interest in applying a global optimization process for applications such as quantum error correction and quantum assertions. This work, based on the pure-quantum circuit optimization procedure by Duncan et al., uses an extension of the formal graphical ZX-calculus called as an intermediary representation of the hybrid circuits to allow for granular optimizations below the quantum-gate level. We define a translation from hybrid circuits into diagrams that admit the graph-theoretical focused-gFlow property, needed for the final extraction back into a circuit. We then derive a number of gFlow-preserving optimization rules for diagrams that reduce the size of the graph, and devise a strategy to find optimization opportunities by rewriting the diagram guided by a Gauss elimination process. Then, after extracting the circuit, we present a general procedure for detecting segments of circuit-like diagrams which can be implemented with classical gates in the extracted circuit. We have implemented our optimization procedure as an extension to the open-source python library PyZX.},

	abstract = {Modern quantum programming languages integrate quantum resources and classical control. They must, on the one hand, be linearly typed to reﬂect the no-cloning property of quantum resources. On the other hand, high-level and practical languages should also support quantum circuits as ﬁrst-class citizens, as well as families of circuits that are indexed by some classical parameters. Quantum programming languages thus need linear dependent type theory. This paper deﬁnes a general semantic structure for such a type theory via certain ﬁbrations of monoidal categories. The categorical model of the quantum circuit description language Proto-Quipper-M in [RS17] constitutes an example of such a ﬁbration, which means that the language can readily be integrated with dependent types. We then devise both a general linear dependent type system and a dependently typed extension of Proto-Quipper-M, and provide them with operational semantics as well as a prototype implementation.},
